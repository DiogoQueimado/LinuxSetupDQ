  - Conky<br>
  - MPV<br>
  - PulseAudio Volume Control<br>
3 - Install Tweak apps<br>

4 - Since I haven't learned how to auto install extension I put an list of needed extensions on the script  which I'll list here.<br>
  - Control Blur Effect On Lock Screen <br>
  - DesktopIcons <br>
  - Dynamic Panel Transparency <br>

As soon as I learn how to auto install via script I'll update it here<br>
5 - Download my Theme and the Change GDM Background.<br>

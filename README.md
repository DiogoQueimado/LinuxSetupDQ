# linuxsetup
Welcome to my linux setup

This will, at the moment Oct 10 2020, do the following things:<br>
1 - Apply all to do updates. 
2 - install all default apps which are:
    - Skype
    - Obs Studio
    - Conky
    - MPV
    - PulseAudio Volume Control
3 - Install Tweak apps
    - Gnome Tweak Tool
4 - Since I haven't learned how to auto install extension I put an list of needed extensions on the script which I'll list here.
  - Control Blur Effect On Lock Screen 
  - DesktopIcons 
  - Dynamic Panel Transparency 
  - Hide Activities Button 
  - Remove Alt+Tab Delay 
As soon as I learn how to auto install via script I'll update it here
5 - Download my Theme and the Change GDM Background.
  - Yaru Colors 
  - Change GDM Background
I think I might be able to also put those script to work automatically and I'll update this as soon as I can.
